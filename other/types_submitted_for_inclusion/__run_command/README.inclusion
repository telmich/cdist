This type is not much of use, as any type can issue code to be executed. 
Thus you can implement the code directly in the calling type.
 Or if you need to reuse it, create a type on its own.

Because this seems to be a common misunderstanding when people come from "non managed areas",
 where script iexecution is the main focus, I documented this in cdist-hacker to clearify.
