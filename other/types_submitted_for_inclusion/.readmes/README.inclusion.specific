Description:

    Type that will probably only work in a very specific environnment
    (like a specific distribution only).
    or has custom code that may not satisfy the "usual" or generic use case.

Problem:

    If included into core/ directory, many users would be disappointed,
    because it does not work for them out of the box.

Solutions:

    - Make visible for others (done: by integrating into other/types_submitted_for_inclusion)
    - Improve: make usable for at least 80% of the standard cases

    or

    - Modify for yourself and use it
