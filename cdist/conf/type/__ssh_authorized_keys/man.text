NAME
----
cdist-type__ssh_authorized_keys - manage ssh authorized_keys files


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Adds or removes ssh keys from a authorized_keys file.

This type also manages the directory containing the authorized_keys
file and sets strict ownership and permissions. You can disable this feature
with the --noparent boolean parameter.

The existence, ownership and permissions of the authorized_keys file itself are
also managed. This can be disabled with the --nofile boolean parameter. It is
then left to the user to ensure that the file exists and that ownership and 
permissions work with ssh.


REQUIRED PARAMETERS
-------------------
key::
   the ssh key which shall be added to this authorized_keys file.
   Must be a string and can be specified multiple times.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
-------------------
owner::
   the user owning the authorized_keys file, defaults to object_id.

state::
   if the given keys should be 'present' or 'absent', defaults to 'present'.

file::
   an alternative destination file, defaults to ~$owner/.ssh/authorized_keys


BOOLEAN PARAMETERS
------------------
noparent::
   don't create or change ownership and permissions of the directory containing
   the authorized_keys file

nofile::
   don't manage existence, ownership and permissions of the the authorized_keys
   file
