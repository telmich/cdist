DESCRIPTION
-----------
cdist is the frontend executable to the cdist configuration management.
It supports different subcommands as explained below.

It is written in Python so it requires :strong:`python`\ (1) to be installed.
It requires a minimal Python version 3.2.

GENERAL
-------
All commands accept the following options:

.. option:: -h, --help

    Show the help screen

.. option:: -d, --debug

    Set log level to debug

.. option:: -v, --verbose

    Set log level to info, be more verbose

.. option:: -V, --version

   Show version and exit


BANNER
------
Displays the cdist banner. Useful for printing
cdist posters - a must have for every office.


CONFIG/INSTALL
--------------
Configure/install one or more hosts.

.. option:: -A, --all-tagged

    use all hosts present in tags db

.. option:: -a, --all

    list hosts that have all specified tags, if -t/--tag
    is specified

.. option:: -b, --enable-beta

    Enable beta functionalities. Beta functionalities
    include inventory command with all sub-commands and
    all options; config sub-command options: -j/--jobs,
    -t/--tag, -a/--all.

.. option:: -c CONF_DIR, --conf-dir CONF_DIR

    Add a configuration directory. Can be specified multiple times.
    If configuration directories contain conflicting types, explorers or
    manifests, then the last one found is used. Additionally this can also
    be configured by setting the CDIST_PATH environment variable to a colon
    delimited list of config directories. Directories given with the
    --conf-dir argument have higher precedence over those set through the
    environment variable.

.. option:: -f HOSTFILE, --file HOSTFILE

    Read additional hosts to operate on from specified file
    or from stdin if '-' (each host on separate line).
    If no host or host file is specified then, by default,
    read hosts from stdin. For the file format see below.

.. option:: -I INVENTORY_DIR, --inventory INVENTORY_DIR

    Use specified custom inventory directory. Inventory
    directory is set up by the following rules: if this
    argument is set then specified directory is used, if
    CDIST_INVENTORY_DIR env var is set then its value is
    used, if HOME env var is set then ~/.cdit/inventory is
    used, otherwise distribution inventory directory is
    used.

.. option:: -i MANIFEST, --initial-manifest MANIFEST

    Path to a cdist manifest or - to read from stdin

.. option:: -j [JOBS], --jobs [JOBS]

    Specify the maximum number of parallel jobs; currently only
    global explorers are supported (currently in beta)

.. option:: -n, --dry-run

    Do not execute code

.. option:: -o OUT_PATH, --out-dir OUT_PATH

    Directory to save cdist output in

.. option:: -p, --parallel

    Operate on multiple hosts in parallel

.. option:: -s, --sequential

    Operate on multiple hosts sequentially (default)

.. option:: --remote-copy REMOTE_COPY

    Command to use for remote copy (should behave like scp)

.. option:: --remote-exec REMOTE_EXEC

    Command to use for remote execution (should behave like ssh)

.. option:: -t, --tag

    host is specified by tag, not hostname/address; list
    all hosts that contain any of specified tags

HOSTFILE FORMAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
HOSTFILE contains hosts per line. 
All characters after and including '#' until the end of line is a comment.
In a line, all leading and trailing whitespace characters are ignored.
Empty lines are ignored/skipped.

Hostfile line is processed like the following. First, all comments are
removed. Then all leading and trailing whitespace characters are stripped.
If such a line results in empty line it is ignored/skipped. Otherwise,
host string is used.

-----
This command allows you to spawn a shell that enables access
to the types as commands. It can be thought as an
"interactive manifest" environment. See below for example
usage. Its primary use is for debugging type parameters.

.. option:: -s SHELL, --shell SHELL

    Select shell to use, defaults to current shell. Used shell should
    be POSIX compatible shell.

FILES
-----
~/.cdist
    Your personal cdist config directory. If exists it will be
    automatically used.
~/.cdist/inventory
    The home inventory directory. If ~/.cdist exists it will be used as
    default inventory directory.
cdist/conf
    The distribution configuration directory. It contains official types and
    explorers. This path is relative to cdist installation directory.
cdist/inventory
    The distribution inventory directory.
    This path is relative to cdist installation directory.

CDIST_LOCAL_SHELL
    Selects shell for local script execution, defaults to /bin/sh.

CDIST_REMOTE_SHELL
    Selects shell for remote script execution, defaults to /bin/sh.

CDIST_OVERRIDE
    Allow overwriting type parameters.

CDIST_ORDER_DEPENDENCY
    Create dependencies based on the execution order.

CDIST_REMOTE_EXEC
    Use this command for remote execution (should behave like ssh).

CDIST_REMOTE_COPY
    Use this command for remote copy (should behave like scp).

EXIT STATUS

CAVEATS
-------
When operating in parallel, either by operating in parallel for each host
(-p/--parallel) or by parallel jobs within a host (-j/--jobs), and depending
on target SSH server and its configuration you may encounter connection drops.
This is controlled with sshd :strong:`MaxStartups` configuration options.
You may also encounter session open refusal. This happens with ssh multiplexing
when you reach maximum number of open sessions permitted per network
connection. In this case ssh will disable multiplexing.
This limit is controlled with sshd :strong:`MaxSessions` configuration
options. For more details refer to :strong:`sshd_config`\ (5).

When requirements for the same object are defined in different manifests (see
example below) in init manifest and in some other type manifest and they differs
then dependency resolver cannot detect dependencies right. This happens because
cdist cannot prepare all objects first and then run objects because some
object can depend on the result of type explorer(s) and explorers are executed
during object run. cdist will detect such case and write warning message.
Example for such a case:

.. code-block:: sh

    init manifest:
        __a a
        require="__e/e" __b b
        require="__f/f" __c c
        __e e
        __f f
        require="__c/c" __d d
        __g g
        __h h

    type __g manifest:
        require="__c/c __d/d" __a a

    Warning message:
        WARNING: cdisttesthost: Object __a/a already exists with requirements:
        /usr/home/darko/ungleich/cdist/cdist/test/config/fixtures/manifest/init-deps-resolver /tmp/tmp.cdist.test.ozagkg54/local/759547ff4356de6e3d9e08522b0d0807/data/conf/type/__g/manifest: set()
        /tmp/tmp.cdist.test.ozagkg54/local/759547ff4356de6e3d9e08522b0d0807/data/conf/type/__g/manifest: {'__c/c', '__d/d'}
        Dependency resolver could not handle dependencies as expected.
