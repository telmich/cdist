# The cdist repository has been moved

The upstream [cdist](https://www.cdi.st) repository
has been moved to
[code.ungleich.ch](https://code.ungleich.ch/ungleich-public/cdist)
to
[avoid confusion as to where upstream is](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1028447#20).

For questions, you can find us on Matrix in `#cdist:ungleich.ch`.
