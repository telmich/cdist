If root's shell is csh or other non-sh compatible, we have problems.
See https://github.com/telmich/cdist/issues/54.

Stuff to try out:

    - "-o SendEnv name" [may break remote exec/copy]
    - cat * | /bin/sh -s could also work, needs testing though

Somebody who is affected should give this a try, especially the 2nd
variant.
