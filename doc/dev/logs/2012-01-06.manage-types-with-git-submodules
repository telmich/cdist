maybe something like this would be handy:

cdist type add git@github.com:asteven/cdist__nfs_server.git
-> adds git submodule to conf/type/__nfs_server


together with type namespaces (https://github.com/asteven/cdist/tree/type-namespaces) this could be a nice way to share multitple types as a bundle of functionality.
